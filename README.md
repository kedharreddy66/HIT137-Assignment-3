## Overview
This repository contains two main projects developed as part of the assignment:

1. **Tkinter AI Application**: A Python-based desktop application using Tkinter with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, decorators, encapsulation, and polymorphism. This application integrates small open-source AI models like image classification, language translation, and facial recognition to provide interactive features to the user.

2. **Pygame Side-Scrolling Game**: A 2D side-scrolling game developed using Pygame, where the player controls a character that can move, jump, and shoot projectiles. The game includes multiple levels, enemies, collectibles, scoring, health, and a game-over screen with a restart option.

## Project Structure

### Explanation of Key Files:
- `Tkinter_Ai_Application/main.py`: The main file of the Tkinter AI application. It demonstrates the use of OOP concepts and integrates AI models.
- `Pygame_2D_Game/main.py`: The main file for the Pygame side-scrolling game, handling player movement, shooting, enemies, and collectibles.
- `ai_models/`: Directory containing the pre-trained AI models used in the Tkinter application.
- `assets/`: Directory containing assets for the game, including images, sounds, and sprites.
- `levels/`: Directory containing the design for each of the three levels in the game.

## Features

### Tkinter AI Application
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implements multiple inheritance, decorators, encapsulation, and method overriding.
- **AI Models Integration**: Incorporates AI models for tasks such as image classification, translation, and facial recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple GUI created using Tkinter, where users can interact with AI models.
  
### Pygame Side-Scrolling Game
- **Character Movement**: The player can run, jump, and shoot projectiles.
- **Enemies and Collectibles**: Includes various enemies and collectibles that affect the player's score and health.
- **Level Design**: Three levels with increasing difficulty, ending with a boss fight.
- **Scoring System**: Tracks player progress based on enemies defeated and collectibles gathered.
- **Health and Lives**: Health bar and lives system for both the player and enemies.
- **Dynamic Camera**: Follows the player smoothly as they move through the level.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For the GUI in the AI application.
- **Pygame**: For game development.
- **Pre-Trained AI Models**: For tasks like image classification and facial recognition.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
