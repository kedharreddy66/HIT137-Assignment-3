## Projects Overview

### 1. **Tank Battle - Pygame Implementation**
A side-scrolling 2D tank game built using Pygame. In this game, players control a tank to move, jump, and shoot while battling enemies and bosses across multiple levels.

- **Folder**: `pygame_tank`
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pygame
- **Details**: [Read the detailed README here](pygame_tank/README.md)

### 2. **Image Classifier App**
A desktop application using a pre-trained AI model (EfficientNet) for image classification. Users can upload images, which the app processes and classifies, displaying the predicted label and confidence score.

- **Folder**: `image_classifier_app`
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Tkinter
- **Details**: [Read the detailed README here](image_classifier_app/README.md)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kedharreddy66/HIT137-Assignment-3.git
   cd (path)/your-repo-name
   ```
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended for each project):
   ```bash
   python -m venv (enviornment_name)
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Each project has its own dependencies listed in its respective `requirements.txt` file. Follow the instructions in the specific project folder.

## How to Use

- Navigate to the respective project folder (`pygame_tank` or `image_classifier_app`) and follow the setup and usage instructions provided in the individual projectâ€™s README file.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed, and the virtual environment (if used) is activated.

## Additional Information

This repository is designed to demonstrate various aspects of software and AI application development using Python. Each project folder contains a detailed `README.md` file explaining setup, usage, and the code structure.
